    "# The Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Schools Data\n",
    "Schools data and School location data is obtained from the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Austhority (ACARA). The advantage of this dataset is that it includes both public and private school sectors. However school asessment data of NAPLAN results is not avialable to private individuals although data could be scraped from a site one school at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "School Profile Data:\n",
    "https://www.acara.edu.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/school-profile-2018.xlsx?sfvrsn=0 \n",
    "School Location Data: \n",
    "https://www.acara.edu.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/school-locations-20189cf512404c94637ead88ff00003e0139.xlsx?sfvrsn=0\n",
    "\n",
    "Each school is identified by a unique ACARA id so school profile and location data can be easily joined. The school location is geocoded and can easily be displayed on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Postcode Geocoded Data\n",
    "Geocoded postcode data is required to support the rental and crime datasets whose granularity is logged at postcode level. Note in Australia a single postcode may span multiple suburbs. Unfortunately geocoded postcode data is no freely available since the postal service decided to monetise the data. There are a number of internet sources available that vary in terms of comprehensiveness and currency. This project has selected the data provided by [Matthew proctor](https://www.matthewproctor.com/australian_postcodes) as the most comprehensive and recent source of geolocated postcode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As postcodes areas do not necessarily correspond directly to electroral or parish boundaries the most accurate way to visualise data encoded via postcode is to use a geojson file of postcode boundaries. This can then be used in conjuction with Folium to create a postal area overlay that will map to the granularity of of data. There is no official geojson file although the Australian Bureau of statistics publishes mapinfo and shape files of [postcode boundaries](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.003July%202011?OpenDocument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately the work in transforming the official postcode shape files into a usable postcode area geojson file was performed by Luke Singham and may be downloaded from his github repo [here](https://github.com/ucg8j/aus_cloropleth/blob/master/au-postcodes-Visvalingam-0.1-density.js). It is possible to generate the geojson file directly from the shap file using a utility called mapshaper which mat be downloaded using the node package manager. However as the postcode shape file has not changed since 2011 the visualisations are based on Luke Signham's geojson data.\n",
